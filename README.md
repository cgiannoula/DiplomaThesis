My Diploma Thesis entitled "Parallelization Techniques in Data Structures and Algorithms" (Bachelor's Degree at National Technical University of Athens). <br />

This Diploma Thesis includes a performance and scalability analysis of concurrent binary search trees and a parallelization of the inherently serial Dijkstra's algorithm on modern multicore platforms employing Transactional Memory and the concept of Helper
Threads.
